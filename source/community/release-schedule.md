# Gluster Release Schedule

## Pre-3.8

Up to version 3.8, generally there have been 3 active versions of GlusterFS. This release schedule is being retired, with the current active versions of 3.6 and 3.7 set to end-of-life (EOL) at n+3 releases (*3.5 has already reached EOL with the release of 3.8 on 2016-06-14*).

## Post-3.8

Going forward, GlusterFS will adopt a schedule of major feature releases approximately every *three* months. Beginning with version 3.8, every-other release will be treated as a Long Term Maintenance (LTM) release, with a planned lifespan of 12 months, and will officially EOL at the **n+4** release. Each interim release will be a Short Term Maintenance (STM) release, with a planned lifespan of only 3 months, and will officially EOL at the **n+1** release.

This new schedule will allow the GlusterFS development team to release new features to the community at a much faster pace, while also limiting the number of versions under concurrent maintenance.

## Minor Releases

A minor release of each of these
versions is generally scheduled every month. As of now the active versions of
GlusterFS are GlusterFS-3.7, GlusterFS-3.8 and GlusterFS-3.9.
This is the tentative release schedule for GlusterFS:

  * **10th of every month:** A minor release of the GlusterFS-3.8 version
  * **20th of every month:** A minor release of the GlusterFS-3.9 version
  * **30th of every month:** A minor release of the GlusterFS-3.7 version
