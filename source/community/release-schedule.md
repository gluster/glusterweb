# Gluster Release Schedule

## Pre-3.8

Prior to release 3.8, generally there were 3 active versions of GlusterFS. This release schedule has been retired, with versions 3.6 and 3.7 set to end-of-life (EOL) at n+3 releases. ***All pre-3.8 versions have reached EOL as of the 3.10 release on 2017-02-27.***

## Post-3.8

Going forward, GlusterFS has adopted a schedule of major feature releases approximately *every three months*. Beginning with version 3.8, every-other release is treated as a **Long Term Maintenance (LTM)** release, with a planned lifespan of 12 months, and will officially EOL at the **n+4** release. Each interim release will be a **Short Term Maintenance (STM)** release, with a planned lifespan of only 3 months, and will officially EOL at the **n+1** release.

This new schedule allows the GlusterFS development team to release new features to the community at a much faster pace while also limiting the number of versions under concurrent maintenance.

## Minor Releases

A minor update release for each maintaned version is generally scheduled monthly. These happen typically on the **10th**, **20th**, and **30th** of the month. The tentative maintenance days are listed in the chart below alongside the maintained versions.
