# Release Schedule

Date             | Task/event
-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------
...              | get requirements addressed, see below for details
30 April 2016    | branch release-3.8, start disabling/removing incomplete features
beginning of May | first beta release
weekly(?) in May | more beta releases, fix bugs, documents known issues
end of May, June | GA (General Availability) release of 3.8
monthly after GA | bugfix releases, improvements to experimental features


# Feature Requirements

All of these requirements need to be done at the point of the branching for 3.8
(see schedule above). When a feature does not address all requirements, it will
be removed from the `release-3.8` branch immediately after branching. This also
counts for features that are proposed as **experimental**.

* **Feature page and technical design**

  Documents merged and moved to the `accepted/release-3.8` directory in the
  [glusterfs-specs repository].

  Source code documentation and implementation details (structures, code-flow,
  ...) should be in the main [glusterfs repository].

* **Source code changes**

  Code changes need to be reviewed and merged. Also a tracker bug that contains
  links to related changes is highly recommended. Tracker bugs for a feature
  should block the [3.8.0 release tracker][glusterfs-3.8.0].

* **Maintainer**

  One or two maintainers for this change need to be listed in the
  [`MAINTAINERS`][MAINTAINERS] file in the sources. This requires least one
  experienced maintainer, possibly one additional 'new' maintainer. All
  maintainers accept the responsibilities that are documented in the
  [Guidelines for maintainers].

* **DiSTAF testcases**

  New features should add testcases for distributed testing with [DiSTAF]. Our
  regresion-tests are running on a single server environment only, DiSTAF makes
  it possible to coordinate testing over multiple systems. Periodic testing
  with DiSTAF is a feature by itself, the developers working on this can be
  contacted for assistance.

* **Release notes**

  Once branched, the included features will need to provide one or more
  paragraphs for the release notes. These can be prepared in advance, there is
  no need to wait for the last minute.

  **Experimental features** should have additional descriptions in the release
  notes about the reason for being in this state and current limitations. Extra
  steps that a user needs to do for enabling need to be included as well (or
  point to the [documentation][Admin Guide]).

* **User Documentation**

  Each feature will need to add contents to the [Admin Guide]. This should
  explain in a user understandable way what the feature should be used for, and
  how admins and users need to configure it.

* **Integration and Eco-system**

  Some features add functionality on top of the Gluster filesystem and/or
  management framework itself. These features are expected to provide usable
  example applications as part of their project.

  Developers for add-on projects should do their best to get packages in
  different Operating System distributions. Inclusion in Fedora, EPEL and/or
  the CentOS Storage SIG are strongly recommended.

* **Advertisement**

  Informing users about the upcoming features is important for the uptake. Blog
  posts and videos should explain how a feature work and how users can configure
  and benefit from it.


# Features in Gluster 3.8

## Protocol improvements for integration with Samba, NFS and others

### Converged HA for NFS-Ganesha and Samba
Integration with [Storhaug], a Pacemaker-based HA solution for clustered
storage platforms.

* **Status**:

### Mandatory lock support for Multiprotocol environment
POSIX.1 does not specify any scheme for mandatory locking. Whereas Linux kernel
provide support for mandatory locks based on file mode bits which is explained
at <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/mandatory-locking.txt>.
But the proposed feature does not adhere completely to the semantics described
by linux kernel. Instead we enforce core mandatory lock semantics at its byte
range granularity level as detailed below without the help of file mode bits.

* **Status**:
  (11-March-2016) Patches posted by Anoop, need review etc.

### RichACL support for GlusterFS
[Richacls] are an implementation of NFSv4 ACLs which has been extended by file
masks to better fit the standard POSIX file permission model. The main goal is
to provide a consistent file permission model locally as well as over various
remote file system protocols like NFSv4 and CIFS; this is expected to
significantly improve interoperability in mixed operating system environments,
both when Linux is used as a client and as a server.

* **Status**:
  (8-March-2016) Userspace `richacl` package is in Fedora, Rajesh has POC
  xlator, needs heavy cleanup and further development.

### Tiering Performance Enhancements
**TODO**: this should probably be split in multiple features? (2) and (3) are
real features that should be called out to users, (1) is close to standard
maintenance of an existing functionality (unless it needs re-design?).

1. Performance enhancements for small files.
2. Limit promotion to hot tier based on filesize.
3. Improve responsiveness for promotion/demotion of files ordered list of files
   based on heat (migration limit based on no. files and MB).

### Gluster/NFS disabled by default
Gluster/NFS does not compete with more current NFS-servers anymore. Only NFSv3
is available, and other features that are expected from NFS-servers are
difficult to implement. NFS-Ganesha is a good replacement for Gluster/NFS. It
becomes time to announce the deprecation of Gluster/NFS so that users start to
look at other more serious solutions.

### SEEK
All modern filesystems support `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` with the `lseek()`
systemcall. This functionality makes it possible to detect holes in files, so
that copies and backups of sparse files do not get the 'holes' allocated with
zero-bytes. Supporting the detection of holes in files reduces the needed
storage and network overhead when copies are made.

* **Status**:
  (20-March-2016) Patches for Gluster merged, Linux kernel FUSE module merged
  (linux-4.5), QEMU merged (2.7), Wireshark merged, NFS-Ganesha unposted POC.

### Periodic DiSTAF testing
[DiSTAF] is a multi node test framework used for automating the test cases related to gluster.

### Leases Support for Gluster
A file lease provides a mechanism whereby the process holding the lease (the
"lease holder") is notified when a process (the "lease breaker") tries to
perform a fop with conflicting access on the same file.

NFS Delegation (similar to lease_locks) is a technique by which the server
delegates the management of a file to a client which guarantees that no client
can open the file in a conflicting mode.

Advantages of these locks is that it greatly reduces the interactions between
the server and the client for delegated files.

This feature now also provides the support to grant or process these
leases/delegations for the files.

* **Status**:
  (16-March-2016) Some patches under review, full design not settled yet. There
  most likely will be a dependency on the new compound FOPs.
